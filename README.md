## Quasar Accounting

A C++ accounting system for Linux/Qt.

License: GPL  
Author: Linux Canada Inc.  
URL: <http://www.linuxcanada.com>  

This code is built from the Quasar 1.4.7 code released by Linux Canada, with patches contributed by the community. The `quasar-GPL` directory contains the contents of `quasar-1.4.7_GPL.tgz` as distributed by Linux Canada, the `patches` directory contains patches collected by the Gentoo Linux package maintainers.

### Version 2

Version 2.x of Quasar was released under a different (non-GPL) licensing scheme, which includes paid options for a supported and maintained version with many extra features, including integration with a Point Of Sale system. Please see <http://www.linuxcanada.com/> for more information.

### Support

Linux Canada have kindly continued to offer some support to users of the GPL version 1 software, see <http://www.linuxcanada.com/mailman/listinfo/quasar-help> for details. For Quasar version 2 full support is available.

A Google Group is available at <http://groups.google.com/group/quasar-accounting> (see [these instructions](http://groups.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=46606) if you prefer email-only subscriptions).

### Packaging

Unless you are familiar with patching and building from source, you may prefer to install a package using your package manager (yum, apt-get etc.) These GitHub sources will mostly be of interest to developers wishing to patch or extend v1.4.7 -- instructions at <http://help.github.com/forking/>.
