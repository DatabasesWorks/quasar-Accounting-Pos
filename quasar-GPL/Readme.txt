Welcome to Quasar Accounting!

Installation and Setup
======================

To get Quasar installed and setup properly, please refer to the PDF
document available online at our web page (http://www.linuxcanada.com).
It will help you through the initial stages of Quasar use and provides
trouble-shooting tips if something isn't working.  When done you should
be able to create a company.


First Company
=============

Once you have Quasar installed and setup, you can create a company
and start setting it up.  Please refer to the User's Guide also
available online.  It will help you through setting up your company
and also give pointers on the use of various aspects of Quasar.


Reference
=========

Finally if there is a field on a screen or something you don't fully
understand, please download and use our reference manual.  It covers
every screen in Quasar and explains the use of each field on the
screen.


Mailing Lists
=============

Linux Canada Inc. has setup mailing lists for different types of
problems or questions.  You can subscribe to the lists from our web
server and once you have been subscribed (remember to reply to the
email that sent to you to verify you actually want to subscribe!),
you can post messages.  The mailing list is monitored by the staff
of Linux Canada Inc. and by other users and we attempt to respond
to problems quickly that are posted there but for more timely support
you will need to purchase a support contract.


Support
=======

Support contracts are available for any level of support you want
from simple email during business hours to direct access to developers
on Quasar.  Please check out the support options on our web page.


License
=======

Quasar Accounting is available with the source code under the GPL
license.  This means you can use it on as many systems as you want
and can even make changes to the code for extra features you need.
You can even then sell your modified Quasar Accounting though any
code you add also has to be under the GPL license and available to
your clients.  Finally with the GPL version you also can't hook
Quasar up to any proprietary product like a proprietary database
(DB2, Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server, ...) or a third-party proprietary
product like a Point-of-Sale package or a Payroll system.  Anything
you link with the GPL version of Quasar Accounting also has to be
available with a GPL license and this is how the GPL license works.

For people who want to make changes to Quasar Accounting and not
place their source code changes under the GPL license or else who
want to use Quasar with a proprietary package, then we do sell a
commercial version of Quasar Accounting.  Its available as two
different packages.  The Quasar Accounting package allows any number
of clients to connect and you simply pay a one time fee.  We also
sell a Quasar Retail package which includes our Point-of-Sale
software.  The Retail package can also be used with any number of
workstation clients but you need to purchase a license for each
Point-of-Sale terminal you will use.  Each of these package doesn't
include the full retail source code but this is available for
resellers who wish to customize Quasar for their vertical market.
