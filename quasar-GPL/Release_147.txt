Release Notes for Quasar 1.4.7:
-------------------------------

Quasar 1.4.7 is a bug fix release for the handheld send/receive function:

	- fixed the receiving of data from the handheld to not use Xon/Xoff
	  flow control since the YModem protocol can have Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q
	  character in the stream.  Using hardware flow control which allowed
	  bumping the baud from 9600 to 38400 so transmission should be a lot
	  faster now.

	- fixed a bug in the auto order by sales history where it was
	  including an extra day of sales in the calculations.

	- fixed a problem when compiling using gcc 4 (Fedora Core 4 for
	  example)

	- setup the xinetd and inetd services to run quasar_clientd with
	  a group of "quasar".
