Release Notes for Quasar 1.4.5:
-------------------------------

Quasar 1.4.5 is a quick bug fix release with just a couple other things
thrown in to make amd64 compiling easier.  The changes are:

	- fixed a bug with date handling in some time zones.  It was
	  working 100% in Mountain time but was broken in Central and
	  perhaps other time zones.

	- fixed bug in the SHA1 code that was getting the wrong crypted
	  value

	- changed Variant and fixed to use int32_t and int64_t to make
	  compiling work better on amd64 systems

	- added checks in quasar_int.h to enforce that the int32_t and
	  int64_t types are the size they should be

	- changed config and data files to be owned by "root" with a
	  group of "quasar" and 0640 permissions

	- fixed harmless warning in Point-of-Sale posting program when
	  processing blank dates
