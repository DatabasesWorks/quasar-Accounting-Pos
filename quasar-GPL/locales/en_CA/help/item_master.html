<H1>Item Master</H1>
<img src="images/item_master.png"><br>
<br>

<p>

Using this screen you can create an item with a single size, cost and
price, or you can identify multiple sizes, costs and prices. You can
link multiple lookup numbers to an item, link specific 
customers to a price, specific vendors to a cost or even create kits
made out of other items. You can enter a container deposit, taxes and
specify if a cost or price includes tax and/or container deposit.
</p>

<p>
The speed in which new items are created can be substantially sped up
by first entering sub-departments containing default data. Sub-departments are created in the sub-department master window. New items
may be defined as items that will be sold, items that will be
purchased, items that will be inventoried, or any combination of all
three. Following is a list of all attributes in the item master
window:
</p>


<h2>Item Number</h2>

<P>The price lookup id for the item.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The description of the item.</p>


<h2>Sub-Department</h2>

<p>The item may be linked to a sub-department. When entering a
sub-department in a new item, the sub-department defaults will be
brought forward and set in the item. Utilization of sub-departments
can substantially speed up item entry.</p> 

<h2>Type</h2>

<img src="images/item_master_type.png"><br>

<h2>Sizes & Numbers</h2>

<br>
<img src="images/item_master_size.png"><br>

<h3>Sizes Table</h3>
<p>

Use the sizes table to define one or more sizes for an item and to
link the "size quantity" and "weight" to each size. The weight is used
for calculating the landed cost of an item.  Note - you must be
consistant with the units of measure used. For example, if you use
kilograms for one item then use kilograms for all items. In addition 

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Size Name</b> - The name of the size.
<li> <b>Quantity</b> - The quantity of item units in the size.
<li> <b>Weight</b> - The weight of the size.

generated Quasar will take the multiple into consideration.
</ul>
</dl>

<h3>Numbers Table</h3>
<p>
Use the numbers table to define one or item numbers that are linked to
an item. Also use the numbers table to link a specific size to an item
number. If no specific size is linked to an item number, then Quasar
will use the default sizes specified in the general folder.

<dl>

</ul>
</dl>


<h2>Flags</h2>

<br>
<img src="images/item_master_flag.png"><br>

<p>Use the flag file to define miscellaneous options for the item

each store.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Store</b> The name of the store.
<li> <b>Location</b> The location in the store in which the item is
stocked. Entering a location assists in finding the item in the item
list and reports. More importantly, the  addition of locations provides the
ability to 
count physical inventory by stock locations rather than having to
count the entire store. 
<li> <b>Stocked?</b> - Toggle on or off. Toggle on if the item is
stocked in the store. Similar to the active flag. The stocked flag provides an
mechanism to reduce the size of lookup lists. Non-stocked items do not

The kit folder provides the mechanism to define a kit. A kit
is an item created from other items. For example, you may use several
items(components) to build a bicycle. Once you have defined a kit you can build them using the "Build" button. <bf>NOTE!</BF> The kit tab is
not available for use unless the purchased toggle is turned off. If the item is
set to purchased the kit tab is blanked out.    

<h3>Build Quantity</h3>

<p>The build quantity defines the number of kits that can be built with
the items listed in the table. For example, if you could build two
widget kits  with the items(components) listed in the table, then the build
quantity would be "2".

<h3>Build Cost</h3>

<p>
Quasar calculates the total cost of all items entered in your build
list.

<img src="images/item_master_extra.png"><br>

<p>
The extra info folder provides the mechanism to define special
attributes required by a company. While Quasar contains most of the
inventory attributes common to the majority of businesses, many people
require the ability to define their own special attributes.

<h3>Attribute Table</h3>

The attribute table is used to define:

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Data Name</b> - Quasar displays the name of the extra data
attributes as pre-defined. 
<li> <b>Value</b> - Enter the value for the extra data attribute.
</ul>
</dl>

<h3>Create Data</h3>
<br>

extra attribute is created, this attribute is created for every item. 

<h3>Delete Data</h3>
<p>
Use extreme CAUTION when deleting a data name. The deletion of the
name deletes the corresponding data value for every item in your database.

<h3>Rename Data</h3>
<p>
Use the rename data button to rename a special attribute. A data name
may be renamed without deleting the data value for each item. 


<h2>Container Deposit</h2>

Some items come in containers that require a container deposit. Note -
Always enter the container deposit by individual selling unit. For
example, if $0.10 is the container deposit for an item and that item
comes in a case of 12, enter $0.10 as the container deposit. 

<h2>Opening Inventory</h2>

<p>The opening inventory attributes can only be entered at the time a
new item is created. Entry, creates an item adjustment journal, posting
to the inventory asset account with the offsetting entry to the historical
balance account. A historical balance account must be defined in order
to utilize this feature.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/item_master_opening.png"><br>

<h3>As of</h3>

<p>The date the inventory was on hand as of.


<h3>Quantity</h3>

<p>The current on hand level of an item. This is an
enter once only attribute and may only be entered when the item is
first being setup. Caution should be taken to
ensure accuracy. Any adjustments to 
on hands after the initial setup of the item 
must be done in the item adjustment window.</p>


<h3>Total Cost</h3>

<p>The total cost of the on hand inventory for the item. This is an
enter once only attribute and may only be entered when the item is
first being setup. Caution should be taken to ensure accuracy. Any
adjustments to the total value after the initial setup of an item must
be done in the item adjustment window.</p>

<h2>Inactive?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to set the item to inactive. Inactive
items may not be purchased or sold. Items with an on order or on hand
quantity may not be set to inactive. Toggle off to re-set the item to
active. </p> 

<h2>Prices</h2>

<p>Click on the "Prices" button to display the price list. From the
price list you can create or edit the item prices.

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>Click on the "Costs" button to display the cost list. From the cost
list you can create or edit the item costs.

<h2>Margin</h2>

<p>Click on the "Margin" button to display the item margin screen. The
item margin screen is used to change the prices of the item based on
the replacement cost, the average cost or the last landed cost.


<h2>Stock</h2>

<p>Click on the "Stock" button to display the stock status for an
item. 

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>Click on the "Build" button to build one or more kits. Specify the
component multiples. For example if the components listed in the build
table created 3
kits, building 3 multiples of the components will create 9 kits. The
build process creates an item adjustment which reduces the inventory
of the components and increases the inventory of the kit.
