<p>The "Customer Type Master" window is used store default data about
a specific type of customer. This default data is then used when
creating a new customer with the customer master screen. If the
interest rate is changed in the customer type master, then the
interest rate is also changed in each of the customer records linked
to the customer type. This will save considerable time if you find a

accounts. Therefore, even if you only have one account type, it is
