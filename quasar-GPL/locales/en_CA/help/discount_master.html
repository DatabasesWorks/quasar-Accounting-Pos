<p> All discounts taken within Quasar must be linked to a pre-defined
discount name for audit purposes. A discount may be treated as a
reduction of a price or as an expense item.

<h2>Name</h2>

<p> The name of the discount.

<h2>Line Discounts?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on if this discount is to be used to
discount individual lines in a transaction.

<h2>Transaction Discounts?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on if this discount is to be used to
discount an entire transaction.

<h2>Account</h2>

<p> If the discount is to be treated as a reduction of price for
account posting purposes leave this attribute blank. If the discount
is to be posted as an expense then enter the expense account.

<h2>Percent</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to define the discount method as
percent. Enter the percent amount. The percentage entered will be
deducted from the regular price of the items. If the percentage is left blank,
Quasar will prompt for the entry at the Point-of-Sale.

<h2>Dollar</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to define the discount method as
dollar. Enter the dollar amount of the discount. Note dollar discount
will be given off of each line if a line discount, and off
of the transaction total in a transaction discount. If the dollar amount is 
left blank, Quasar will prompt for the entry at the Point-of-Sale.
