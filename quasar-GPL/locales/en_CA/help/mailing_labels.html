<p>
The mailing list has four display folders. The default is "Customer"
in which you can print customer mailing labels. Click on "Vendor" to
print vendor mailing labels. Click on "Employee" to print employee
mailing labels. Click on "Personal" to print mailing labels from the
personal 
cards.</p>

<p> You can sort the mailing label list by clicking on the column header
and selecting ascending or descending order.

<h2>Selecting Labels</h2>

<h2>Type</h2>

<p>Select a predefined label type. Print one of each type to view. Note
that the page type and paper size selected when printing must
correspond with the label type.

<h2>Labels/Card</h2>

<p>Enter the number of each mailing label that you wish to print.

<h2>Start Row</h2>

<p>Enter the row number on which the first label will be printed. For
example, if you have already printed labels in all columns in row one
and row two then you will begin printing your first label in row
three. This attribute works in conjunction with the start column
attribute and is a feature to ensure that you do not waste expensive 
labels. 

<h2>Start Column</h2>

<p>Enter the column number on which the first label will be printed. For
example, if you have already printed labels in the first column then
you will begin printing your first label in column two. This attribute
works in conjunction with the start row 
attribute and is a feature to ensure that you do not waste expensive 
labels. 

<h2>Print</h2>

Select print to print the high-lighted labels.
