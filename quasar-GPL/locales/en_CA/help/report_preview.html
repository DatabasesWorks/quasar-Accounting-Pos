<h1>Report Preview</h1>

<img src="images/report_view.png"><br>

<p> The report view window provides the ability to preview a report on
the screen prior to printing it to a printer. From this window the
existing report may be edited or a new report may be created. The main
body of the window displays the report.

</p>

<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>
Click on the refresh button to refresh the data on the screen.

<h2>Format</h2>

<h2>Configure</h2>

<p>
By high-lighting a report in the list and clicking on the "Edit" button you can
utilize the "Report Configuration" window to edit the existing
report. You may also edit a report by double clicking on the report in
the list. Once a report has been edited you may save it under its
existing name, or you may save the changes as a new report leaving the
existing report in tact.
<p>
The reports that you will be
configuring will be displayed in vertical columns and horizontal rows. In
order to configure a report you will need to:

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> define what data will be shown in the vertical columns
<li> sort the order of the horizontal rows  
<li> filter out any data that is not required
</ul>
</dl>

<p>

Accordingly,
the report configuration screen has three folders, show,
sort and filter. 
<p>

<b>Note:</b> At any time during your configuration you may click
on the "OK" button to view the results of your configuration and
then return to the configuration by clicking on the "Configure"
button.

name, the report will be sorted by data type first and by name within
the respective data types. The order you add columns to the sort list
will determine the sort hierarchy.

<h3>Filter a Report</h3>

<p>
A report filter filters out data that you do not want to appear on a
report, leaving only desired data for viewing. Quasar accounting
software has some very special and powerful filter
functionality. However, with power, comes a level of complexity. 
As it is complex please review the Quasar User's Guide for more
information.

<h2>Save - Save As</h2>

To save a report that you have configured click on "File" in the top
right hand corner of the report view window. Follow by clicking on
either "Save" or "Save As". "Save" will save the report over-writing
your existing report. If you click on "Save As" the save as window
will be displayed. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Enter the name of the report and the module or folder that you wish
the report to be stored in. At this point you may create a new module.
For example, Joe may set up a module called
"Joe". The new module will display with a tab on the report list.
