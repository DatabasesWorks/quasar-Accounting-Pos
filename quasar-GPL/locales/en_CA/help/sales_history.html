<br>

<h2>Data Selection</h2>

Use this section to select the item, size and store for the sales
history you wish to view.

<h3>Item Number</h3>

<p>The item number of the item to view.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Quasar displays the description of the item.

<h3>Size</h3>

<p> You may view the sales of all sizes or the sales of an individual
size. Select "All" or select the individual size.

<h3>Store</h3>

<p> You may view the sales of all stores or you may enter a
store to view.

<h3>Date</h3>

<p>The ending date of the sales history to view.

<h2>Data Format</h2>

In this section define the format in which you wish to view the
sales history. 

<h3>Quantity Size</h3>

In Quasar an item may have multiple sizes. For example, a soft drink
may be sold as a case of 12, or as an individual bottle. Whether you
sold them as cases or bottles you may view the sales history as if the
sales were in either size. This feature is particularily useful if you
purchase a product in a different size than you sell it and wish to
view sales by the purchasing size.
 
<h3>Period</h3>

<p>Select the period to view. The period to view may be expressed in
months, weeks or days.<br>

attribute. Enter the number of periods that you wish to view. For
example, if you select the period "Month" and enter "6" as the count
then 6 months of sales history will be displayed as a total of each of
the last 6 months.
