<H1>Promotion Batch Master</H1>

<p>
The promotional selling prices for multiple items can be set using this
screen. Prices will take effect during the promotion start and stop dates
inclusive. A promotion batch will not be in effect until the batch is
"Executed". When a promotion batch is executed Quasar creates a price record
for each item in the batch. Individual items can then be edited using the
Quasar Price Master screen. You "CANNOT" edit items within and executed
promotion batch itself.

<p>
An exciting feature of Quasar is that you can enter the selling quantity that
you have purchased for the promotion. During the promotion you can run a
promotion activity report to see the on hand status of your promotion stock.
