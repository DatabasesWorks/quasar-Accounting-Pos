<br>

<p>
The cash reconcile screen is the central screen for conducting cash
reconciliation for point-of-sale activities. In Quasar the cash
reconciliation can be by either point-of-sale station method or by
employee method. The method of cash reconciliation can be set in the
Quasar configuration area.
</p>


<h2>Follow These Steps:</h2>
<p>
The cash reconciliation process requires the following steps be
followed:

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> a ringoff is conducted at a Quasar point-of-sale station to
close an employee or station shift
<li> a cash count is created for the shift
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> go to the cash reconcile srceen
<li> high-light the work station for which the count will be created
<li> click on the "Create Count" button and enter the actual cash count
for the work station 
</ul>
</dl>
<li> the actual cash counted is reconciled with the totals generated
by Quasar for the shift 
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> click on the "Reconcile" button in the cash reconcile screen
<li> carefully view the reconcile screen as it displays what you have
actually counted to what was really counted
<li> post the count only if the over/short amounts make sense; <b>NOTE...NEVER
POST WITH LARGE OVER/SHORTAGES....FIND AND FIX YOUR PROBLEM FIRST</b>
</ul>
</dl>
<li> over/short records are automatically generated by Quasar
<li> the posting of a shift transfers the funds counted to the safe
<li> cash is deposited from the safe to the bank as required
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> click on the "Bank Deposit" button in the cash reconcile screen 
<li> enter the amount of each tender to deposit; <b>NOTE..SEVERAL
DEPOSITS MAY BE REQUIRED TO SEPERATE BANK ACCOUNTS</b>.
</ul>
</dl>
<li> a shift close is conducted on the safe in order to reconcile the
total cash in the safe
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> high-light the safe work station
<li> click on the "Shift Close" button to close the shift for the safe
</ul>
</dl>
<li> if a tender is carried forward in the safe from one day to the next, then you must create a cash count for the safe otherwise it will show as a shortage
<li> the cash left in the safe (if any) is reconciled
<li> the shift for the safe is posted 
</ul>
</dl>

<p>
The cash reconciliation screen is divided in two main sections. The
top half and the bottom half. The top half shows the status of each
point-of-sale station or each employee. The bottom half contains two
folders. One folder displays the shifts and counts. The other
folder contains setup criteria.
</p>

<p>Following is an explanation of the attributes in the cash reconcile
screen:
</p>

<h2>Date</h2>

<p>
The date of your cash reconciliation. The date may be changed as
required. The cash reconcile screen will display all open data that exists
up to and including the date entered.

<h2>Store</h2>

<p>
The store for which the cash reconcile is being created.

<h2>Status Table</h2>

<p>
The status table displays each employee/station relative to cash
reconciliation. 

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Number</b> - The number of the employee or point-of-sale station.
<li> <b>Station/Employee</b> - The station or employee.
<li> <b>Not Rungoff</b> - Quasar displays the total number of
transactions for the employee or station that are not rungoff.
<li> <b>Shifts</b> - Quasar displays the total number of shifts for
the employee or station that are not posted.
<li> <b>Counts</b> - Quasar displays the total number of counts for
the employee or station that are not posted.
</ul>
</dl>

<p>
The following example shows the reconciliation status table with two
transactions not rungoff, no shifts closed and no counts.</p>
<br>

<p>
The following example shows the reconciliation status table with all
transactions rungoff, one shift closed and no counts.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/cash_reconcile_status2.png"><br>
<br>

<p>To view or work with a shift, high-light the appropriate line in
the status table. In our example we have high-lighted the station
called "POS 1". Note that there is one shift showing in the status and
this shift is now displayed in the shifts and counts section.</p>

high-light the appropriate line in 
the status table. In our example we have high-lighted the station

<h2>Setup</h2>

<br>
<img src="images/cash_reconcile_setup.png"><br>
<br>
<p> The setup folder displays the setup criteria for cash
reconciliation.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Safe Station</b> - When point-of-sale stations post cash
reconciles Quasar transfer the funds to the safe station. Identify the
safe station.
<li> <b>Safe Store</b> - Multi-store operations will transfer funds
from the point-of-sale stations to the safe work station. Define the
store where the safe station is located.
<li> <b>Over/Short Account</b> - When a cash reconcile containing an
over/short amount is posted, the expense for the over/short is allocated
to the over/short account defined here.
<li> <b>Transfer Account</b> - The transfer account is required for
transferring tenders from a station to the safe.
</ul>
</dl>

<h2>Shift Close</h2>
<p>
A shift is closed on a Quasar point-of-sale device by completing the
ringoff function. For all other work stations such as the "Safe" the shift
is closed by clicking on the shift close button.

<h2>Create Count</h2>
<p>
To create a count for a shift click on the "Create Count" button. See
the "Count Tenders" section for details on the count tenders screen.

<h2>Bank Deposit</h2>
<p>
The bank deposit can only be created from the safe station. To deposit
funds from the safe to the bank click on the "Bank Deposit". See the
"Bank Deposit" section for details on the bank deposit screen.

<h2>Tender Adjustment</h2>
<p>
To adjust the amount of one or more tenders use the tender adjustment
screen. See the "Tender Adjustment" section for details on the tender
adjustment screen. 

<h2>Tender Transfer</h2>
<p>
Tenders can be transferred from one station to another. For example,
for a cash pickup from a point-of-sale till to the safe, use the
tender transfer screen. For details on the tender transfer screen see
the "Tender Transfer" section.

<h2>Reconcile</h2>
<br>
<img src="images/cash_reconcile_reconcile.png"><br>
<br>
To reconcile a shift click on the "Reconcile" button. When we say
reconcile a shift we mean to compare the actual tenders counted to
required amounts as calculated by Quasar. Following is a list of the
attributes in the reconcile screen:

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Tender</b> - Quasar displays the name of each tender.
<li> <b>Shifts</b> - Quasar displays the calculated tender quantities
for the shifts being reconciled.
<li> <b>Counts</b> - Quasar displays the actual counts for each tender.
<li> <b>Over/Short</b> - Quasar displays the amount of the over/shorts
for each tender.
<li> <b>Post</b> - To accept the over/shorts as they are and post the
shift click on "Post". If you do not accept the over/short amount and
wish to investigate further then click on cancel.
</ul>
</dl>

<h2>View a Shift</h2>

<p> You can edit or view a shift by double clicking on a specific
shift for a station or employee. Double clicking on a shift will
display the shift view screen. For details on the shift view screen
see the "Shift View" section. 

<h2>View or Edit an Existing Count</h2>

<p>
You can edit or view an existing count by double clicking on a
count. For details of the Count Tenders screen see the "Count Tenders"
