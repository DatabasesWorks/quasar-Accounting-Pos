<H1>Location Master</H1>
<img src="images/location_master.png">

<p> The location master window is used to define the location
addresses within your business. These location addresses can then be
used for item reporting and for physical inventory purposes.

<H2>Name</H2>

<P>The name of the location. The location name is unique in that you
can not enter it manually. Quasar creates the location name from the
section, fixture and bin. For example, section "Tools", when combined
with fixture "Aisle1" and bin "34" will create the name
"Tools,Aisle1,34".

<h2>Store</h2>

<p>The store in which the location is found.

<h2>Section</h2>

<p> The highest level in the item location. For example, in a hardware
store or warehouse you may have a tool section, paint section,
plumbing section and an electrical section.  In a grocery store or
warehouse you may have a canned foods section, meat section, and
produce section. In a shoe store you may have a mens casual section
and a ladies casual section.

<h2>Fixture</h2>

<p> The second level in the item location. For example, an item may be
in section "Tools" and on fixture "Aisle1". 

<h2>Bin</h2>

The lowest level in the item location. This will be the
actual bin or shelf in which the item is located. Of course what you
consider to be a bin is entirely up to you.

<h2>Inactive?</h2>

<p>Toggle on or off. Toggle on to set the location to inactive. Toggle off to re-set the location to active.
