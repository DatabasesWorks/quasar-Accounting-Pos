<h1>Cost Master</h1>
<img src="images/cost_master.png"><br>
<br>

<p> The cost master file is used to link costs to items. Quasar
provides multiple cost types and multiple ways to link costs to
items. You may establish multiple costs for one item. In that case,
Quasar reviews all the available costs for a specific vendor and
assigns them the lowest cost available at the time.

<h2>Item Selection</h2>

<p> A cost can be linked to an individual item, a group of items, a
sub-department and a specific item size.

<h3>Item</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a specific item to which the
cost will be linked.

<h3>Item Group</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter an item group. All items
linked to the group will be linked to the cost.

<h3>Sub-department</h3> 

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a specific sub-department. All
items linked to the sub-department will be linked to the cost.

<h3>Size</h3>

<p> Enter the size of the item(s) that the cost will be linked to.

<h2>Card Selection</h2>

<p> A cost by default is linked to all vendors. This default may be
changed and the cost may be linked to a specific vendor or a
specific group of vendors.

<h3>Card</h3> 

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to link a cost to a specific
vendor. 

<h3>Card Group</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to link a cost to a specific group of
customers. 

<h2>Store</h2>

<p> If the cost is valid only in a specific store, enter that
store. If blank the cost will be valid in all stores.

<h2>Promotion?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on if the cost is a promotional cost.

<h2>Discountable?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on if the cost  may be further discounted
at the point of purchase.

<h2>Start Date</h2>

<p> Use this attribute in conjunction with the "Stop Date" to define
a range of dates within which the cost will be valid.  If a date is
entered the cost will be valid on or after the date entered. If left
blank the cost will be valid up until the stop date.

<h2>Stop Date</h2>

<p> Use this attribute in conjunction with the "Start Date" to define
a range of dates within which the cost will be valid. If a date is
entered the cost will be valid before or on the date entered. If left
blank the cost will be valid indefinitely

<h2>Day of Week</h2>

<p> The day(s) of the week that a cost is valid may be defined
individually. The day mask format is in this order: Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Therefore if you set
the day mask to be "NNNNNYY" then the cost would be valid only on
Saturday and Sunday.

<h2>Minimum Qty</h2>

<p> The cost may be valid only after a minimum qty of the item(s)
have been purchased. For example the regular cost on an item is
10.00 each. But if you buy twelve of them the cost would be 9.00
each. Enter the minimum quantity of units that you must buy to
receive this cost. If zero, the cost is valid for any quantity.

<h2>Qty Limit</h2>

<p> You may limit the quantity of items that may be sold at a special
cost. For example, the regular cost of an item may be $10.00 each. You can
put this item on special for $6.00 and limit the quantity that a
customer may purchase on a single invoice to 2.

<h2>Cost  Method</h2>

<p> Quasar has multiple costing methods. 

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a single cost and/or at/for
costing. A single cost is simply one item for a single cost. For
example if you enter ".50" then the cost of each unit of sale will be
$0.50. . At/For costing is a quantity for a cost. For
example, if you enter "3/1.00" the cost will be three items for
$1.00. You may also enter a combination like ".50 3/1.00". In this
case you would pay $0.50 each or $1.00 for combinations of three.

<h3>Percent Off</h3>

<p>Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a percentage off discount. For
example, if "10%" is entered here and the cost of an item is $1.00
then the cost charged  will be (1.00 - 0.10) $0.90.

<h3>Dollar Off</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a specific dollar discount to
take off of an item. For example, if you enter "$1.00" here and the
regular cost of the item is $10.00, then you will be charged
(10.00 - 1.00) $9.00 for the item.
