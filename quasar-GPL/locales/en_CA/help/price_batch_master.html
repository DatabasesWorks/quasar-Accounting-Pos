<H1>Price Batch Master</H1>

<p>
The selling prices for one or multiple items can be changed in a batch. The
batch must be executed for the prices to take effect. Executed batches are
stored as inactive for future reference. You may add items manually to the
batch, or you may select the items from a department, sub-department, item
group, location, purchase order or vendor invoice. You can calculate the new
selling price of all items in the table by clicking on the ``Calculate'' 
  button. The new price can be calculated using markup, margin, a percentage
  increase or the items target margin. After calculating the new prices you
  can round them using your rounding rules. Rounding rules must be setup in
  your Quasar Configuration screen for the store. Click on "Round" on the
  right hand side to round your prices. Next, after calculating new
  prices and rounding them you may execute the batch to put the new prices in
  effect or you may choose to file the batch and execute it at a later
  date. Price labels may also be generated from the price batch.

<br>

Calculates the new selling prices. You may calculate the new selling
prices by selecting one of the following: 

<h3>Use Markup?</h3>

Calculates the selling price by marking the price
  up from cost by the entered amount. For example, marking up an item
  that costs $1.00 by a 50% markup will set the new selling price to
  $1.50.

<h3>Use Margin?</h3>

 Calculates the selling price so that the desired
  margin of profit is achieved. For example, to achieve a 50% margin
  of profit on an item that costs $1.00 the selling price will be set
  to $2.00.

<h3>% Change</h3>

 Calculates the selling price based on a percentage
  change from the current price. Entering a positive percentage change
  will increase the price by that percentage. Entering a negative
  percentage change will decrease the selling price by that percentage.

<h3>Use Target</h3>

 Calculates the selling price of each item based on
  its target margin.
