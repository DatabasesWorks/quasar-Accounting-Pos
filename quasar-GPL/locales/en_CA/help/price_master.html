<h1>Price Master</h1>
<img src="images/price_master.png"><br>
<br>

<p> The price master file is used to link prices to items. Quasar
provides multiple price types and multiple ways to link prices to
items. You may establish multiple prices for one item. In that case,
Quasar reviews all the available pricing for a specific customer and
gives them the lowest price available at the time.

<h2>Item Selection</h2>

<p> A price can be linked to an individual item, a group of items, a
sub-department and a specific item size.

<h3>Item</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a specific item to which the
price will be linked.

<h3>Item Group</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter an item group. All items
linked to the group will be linked to the price.

<h3>Sub-department</h3> 

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a specific sub-department. All
items linked to the sub-department will be linked to the price.

<h3>Size</h3>

<p> Enter the size of the item(s) that the price will be linked to.

<h2>Card Selection</h2>

<p> A price by default is linked to all customers. This default may be
changed and the price may be linked to a specific customer or a
specific group of customers.

<h3>Card</h3> 

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to link a price to a specific
customer. 

<h3>Card Group</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to link a price to a specific group of
customers. 

<h2>Store</h2>

<p> If the price is valid only in a specific store, enter that
store. If blank the price will be valid in all stores.

<h2>Promotion?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on if the price is a promotional price.

<h2>Discountable?</h2>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on if the price may be further discounted
at the point of sale.

<h2>Start Date</h2>

<p> Use this attribute in conjunction with the "Stop Date" to define
a range of dates within which the price will be valid.  If a date is
entered the price will be valid on or after the date entered. If left
blank the price will be valid up until the stop date.

<h2>Stop Date</h2>

<p> Use this attribute in conjunction with the "Start Date" to define
a range of dates within which the price will be valid. If a date is
entered the price will be valid before or on the date entered. If left
blank the price will be valid indefinitely

<h2>Day of Week</h2>

<p> The day(s) of the week that a price is valid may be defined
individually. The day mask format is in this order: Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Therefore if you set
the day mask to be "NNNNNYY" then the price would be valid only on
Saturday and Sunday.

<h2>Minimum Qty</h2>

<p> The price may be valid only after a minimum qty of the item(s)
have been purchased. For example the regular price on an item is
10.00 each. But if you buy twelve of them the price would be 9.00
each. Enter the minimum quantity of units that a customer must buy to
receive this price. If zero, the price is valid for any quantity.

<h2>Qty Limit</h2>

<p> You may limit the quantity of items that may be sold at a special
price. For example, the regular price of an item may be $10.00 each. You can
put this item on special for $6.00 and limit the quantity that a
customer may purchase on a single invoice to 2.

<h2>Price Method</h2>

<p> Quasar has multiple pricing methods. 

<h3>Price</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a single price and/or at/for
pricing. A single price is simply one item for a single price. For
example if you enter ".50" then the price of each unit of sale will be
$0.50. . At/For pricing is a quantity for a price. For
example, if you enter "3/1.00" the price will be three items for
$1.00. You may also enter a combination like ".50 3/1.00". In this
case you would pay $0.50 each or $1.00 for combinations of three.

<h3>Cost Plus</h3>

<p>Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a cost plus percentage.
 Cost plus pricing provides the ability to set the price at your
cost plus a percentage markup. For example, if you set the cost plus
 at "10%" and your cost for an item is $1.00, all customers linked
 to the price would pay $1.10.

<h3>Percent Off</h3>

<p>Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a percentage off discount. For
example, if "10%" is entered here and the price of an item is $1.00
then the price charged the customer will be (1.00 - 0.10) $0.90.

<h3>Dollar Off</h3>

<p> Toggle on or off. Toggle on to enter a specific dollar discount to
take off of an item. For example, if you enter "$1.00" here and the
regular price of the item is $10.00, then the customer will be charged
(10.00 - 1.00) $9.00 for the item.
