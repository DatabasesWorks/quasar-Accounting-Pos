<h1>Charge List</h1>

<img src="images/charge_list.png"><br>
<br>
The charge list displays a list of the extraordinary charges
that can appear on purchase orders and vendor invoices. Quasar has provisions
for both internal charges and external charges. An internal charge is
included on the vendor's invoice. An example of an internal charge
would be a franchise service fee. An external charge is not included
on the vendor's invoice, but rather is billed by a third party. Freight
by a third party carrier would be an external charge. Charges provide
a mechanism to properly calculate the actual cost of receiving goods and
services. With the use of charges Quasar can accurately calculate the
landed cost of each item thus providing a true margin when items are sold.
